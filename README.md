Recursion Challenge

This app randomly and recursively draws circles in a specific pattern with a random. Hitting F5 will redraw the circles in a random color.

It was inspired by a YouTuber (Daniel Shiffman): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPsZwrV9ld0

He programs it in p5.js (JavaScript). I followed along with the video translating everything into Python, using Pygame and a 'package' that I made to mimic some of the p5.js/ Processing commands.
